<p>I started from humble beginnings. Pixel colour detection to automatically reset my Pokemon emulator to get a rare Shiny. Making an "Impossible Game" for my High School Software Dev project. Pulling market prices with a web scraper. Triangulating game coordinates. From learning programming with Java and Unity in first year to building Mobile web apps with React Native.</p> <br>
			<p>Then in second year, I applied my skills to making minecraft mods. Parsing the chat log output to automatically answer trivia questions. A gameshow that heals you for correct answers and strikes you with lightning for incorrect ones. A trap that immobilizes monsters. A shadow clone you can switch positions with - and aims a bow and arrow at a target when you do.</p> <br>
			<p>Then in Third Year: A Games Project from scratch with a group of amazing students. A vertical slice full of potential. A hefty six-month game design project. Exhilarating.</p><br>
			<p>I love programming. Problem solving. Utilising my skills to get ahead. Let me put them to good use.</p>
